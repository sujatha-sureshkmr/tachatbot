Instructions for Working with High-Voltage Electrical Systems
It appears to be a set of instructions for working with high-voltage electrical systems, specifically with Li-ion batteries and battery controllers. Here's a breakdown of the steps:
Precautions
Wear insulated protective gear and use insulated tools to prevent electric shock.
Removing components
Remove the service plug to prevent electric shock. * Remove the vehicle communications harness and voltage detection harness. * Remove the Li-ion battery controller. * Disconnect the high-voltage harness engagement detection switch harness connector. * Disconnect the PTC heater harness connector.
Responsibility
Clearly identify the persons responsible for high-voltage work.
Installing components
Install the bus bar to the correct position with extreme caution. * Put on insulating protective gear to prevent electric shock. * Install the Li-ion battery controller.
Securing components
Remove the mounting nuts and bolt. * Remove the bus bar nut caps.
Reassembly
If the battery pack is to be disassembled, remove the battery pack upper case. * Invert the service plug switch bracket. * Close the bus bar cover.
Important
Be sure to wear insulated protective gear and use insulated tools throughout the process. * Put the removed service plug in a pocket to prevent it from coming into contact with the terminals.
